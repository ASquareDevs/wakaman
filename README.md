# Wakaman - A Pac-Man Implementation

Wakaman is a Pac-Man implementation done in Unity by Leonardo Tagliaro.

## Description

This is my take on 80's arcade classic Pac-Man done in Unity. It was a project done for a job interview. Unfortunately I didn't pass, but the project still contains some interesting ideas and solutions to some issues I faced.

## Key features
- Animator-based State Machine for the AI;
- Observer pattern for Audio and Game Events;
- A* Pathfinding for the Ghosts - better than the original algorithm!
